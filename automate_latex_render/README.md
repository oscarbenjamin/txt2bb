# Web interfacing utility for Blackboard

This script will provide a fast way to render LaTeX (actually MathML) code into
actual equations without needing to manually edit then save and submit the
question again.
## Dependencies:

This currently requires both Chrome and the chrome driver to allow for website
interactions.

* Google Chrome
* Chrome Webdriver found [Here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=81.0.4044.69/)
* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)


## Usage:

To run this script you will first need to have created a test in Blackboard using txt2bb.py

Once the test is created, find the test on Blackboard, click its drop down menu and select 'edit test' which
will take you to the editing page in which the questions can be edited
indivually. Copy the current url of this page to your clipboard.

The file can then be run with 

```
python3 bb_interact.py 'Blackboard url' [--hide] [--randomise]
```

Where the blackboard url should be placed between quotations.

The optional `--hide` flag will run this script without opening an actual
Chrome browser but will require you to enter your login details into the
terminal rather than the secure login page directly.

The optional `--randomise` flag will check the box to randomise the order in
which answers are displayed for the multi choice and multi answer questions
